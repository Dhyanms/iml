# IML_SEE
This project gives us a detailed description about the prediction of house prices in Bengaluru. This repository contains a collection of machine learning models for predicting house prices. Different models have been implemented and compared to determine their effectiveness in predicting house prices based on various features.
# Models Implemented
1. Linear Regression
2. Lasso Regression
3. Random Forest Regression
4. Gradient Boosting Regression
5. Support Vector Machine
6. XG Boost
# Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing these models is the Bengaluru_House_Data dataset from Kaggle. It contains various features such as the size of the house, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, location, etc., along with the corresponding sale prices.
